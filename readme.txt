### AGE VERIFICATION: THE FREE AND SIMPLE AGE POP-UP FOR WordPress

**Protect** certain product categories (or single products) from access by minors. This can be useful, for many shop owners selling alcohol, tobacco or other adult products. 

Often a review/verification of age is **required by law** to make it as hard as possible for minors to get there hands on adult products. However, confusing and complicated verification popups can often make the visitor leave your site and look for alternatives, the competition is just one click away!

With our WordPress plugin, we believe that we found an elegant solution to this problem. You can change the appearance of the **popup** however, you like and give for example a look into your product with a picture directly inside the popup window.

### Appearance and Functionallity

* Adjust colors and shadows to fit your website's branding.
* Support for a handful of pre-styled verification looks, from a bright to a dark appearance.
* Choose between a simple yes/no verification or a date picker verification.
* Write the text displayed to the user and configure a lot more with our options page.

### Configuration: Make your Popup stand out

### The option page is divided into 4 sections, General/Style/Privacy and Texts.

* **General** Configure internal functions like the minimum age to pass the verification or the duration that a user will be remembered. You can also configure the location for your popup and place it in any product, product-category, page or post you want.
* **Style** Optimize the appearance of your popup and make it look like it was made just for your website, you can control the colors and fonts, choose an image + logo and decide between a birthday date picker or a simple yes/no popup as a verification method. We are also providing quick style options at the top to get you started more quickly.
* **Privacy** Since the popup is an overlay that will darken your whole website (and your footer) we wanted to give you the option to have legal links on the popup itself. Insert a link for your "privacy policy" and your "terms and conditions" using a WordPress page.
* **Custom Texts** If the default texts are not suited for your site, you have the option to change all the texts in this section. If you leave a text field empty, then the default value will be used.

### General

Before optimizing the look and feel of your age verification, you need to select one or more products, categories, pages or posts where we will force a visitor to verify his age. Do this directly on the "General" section of the plugin options, under the "Placement" headline.

Also, don't forget to configure the **minimum age** inside the "General" tab, visitors younger than the defined minimum age will not pass the verification. By default, it's set to 21.

### Style

This section is meant to be the place to change your popup's appearance. You can change the colors of the Submit button or the fonts. You should consider placing an image and a logo for your popup to attract the visitor's attention.

Try our preset / themes out, found at the top of the section.

**NOTE:** The minimum age will only be used if you configure the birthday date picker, not the simple yes/no verification method.
**Important:** If you need to make style customizations using CSS please prefix your code with the **.awar-overlay** class.

### Privacy

You should fill out this form if you want to insert legal links on our popup, this helps with the GDPR.

### Custom Text

Customize the headlines, titles, messages and date picker texts here. You should consider changing the "Popup/Main Title" if you use the simple yes/no verification to something like: "Are you 18 years old?"
